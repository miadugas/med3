I started Web development 5 years ago and started as a Frontend Developer with HTML5, CSS3, 
Scss, & JavaScript .  Over the last year I have graduated from The University of Denverâ€™s 24 week 
Full-Stack Development Bootcamp and have been working as a Full-Stack Developer primarily with the 
MERN stack. I am quite comfortable working with Node.js and I build complex REST api's using this 
stack. With Nodejs I prefer to use MongoDB as database solution however I am also comfortable
 working with RDBMS databases like MySQL.

 With my skill set and experience, I am confident I would bring great value and vision to any 
 project. Most of my recent work has been in private repos due to work, NDAs, agencies, etc. 
 Have a project you would like to work on, want to collaborate on a project? Reach out to me.
